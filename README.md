# Wikipedia-Game-Bot

This is a bot that plays the ["Wikipedia game"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game). It used the spaCy NLP library to select links most closely related to the target page. It works decently
for pages that are reasonably close, but is still bad at deeper searches. I'll probably improve the algorithm later to better navigate when it is far from the target page.
